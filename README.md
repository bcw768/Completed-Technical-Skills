# Completed Technical Skills
## By Bethany Williams

### GitHub
On August 24, 2018, I completed the initial 8 GitHub Training courses. Within these courses, I explored many different aspects of the platform, including a basic introduction, how to communicate well using Markdown, how to create sites and blogs such as this one through GitHub pages, how to manage and merge conflicts, an introduction to HTML and webpage building, how to best communicate via GitHub, how to upload existing projects, and how to migrate repositories. These courses gave me a good base-level understanding of GitHub and how to use it effectively and engagingly.

### PowerShell
On September 16, 2018, I completed the Microsoft Virtual Academy PowerShell: Beginner path and earned a [badge](https://mva.microsoft.com/RewardEvidence.aspx/?key=haaNjgCPWTj_pmyGijh6Zw2) demonstrating what I learned. Through this course, I gained knowledge of basic PowerShell features, the Help system, the pipeline and the four-step solution, remoting and how it works, automation and security goals of PowerShell, and scripting and toolmaking through ISE. I also learned about PowerShell Desired State Configuration, performing a push deployment, configuring pull servers, discovering available resources, enhancing configurations, and working cross-platform with Linux. Overall, this course introduced me to PowerShell and allowed me to become familiar with this important technology.
