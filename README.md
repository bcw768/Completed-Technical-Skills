### PowerShell
On September 16, 2018, I completed the Microsoft Virtual Academy PowerShell: Beginner path and earned a [badge](https://mva.microsoft.com/RewardEvidence.aspx/?key=haaNjgCPWTj_pmyGijh6Zw2) demonstrating what I learned. Through this course, I gained knowledge of basic PowerShell features, the Help system, the pipeline and the four-step solution, remoting and how it works, automation and security goals of PowerShell, and scripting and toolmaking through ISE. I also learned about PowerShell Desired State Configuration, performing a push deployment, configuring pull servers, discovering available resources, enhancing configurations, and working cross-platform with Linux. Overall, this course introduced me to PowerShell and allowed me to become familiar with this important technology.
